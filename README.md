<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1> 
<hr>
<p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a very simple game where the user has to connect a straight line by using either 
X or an O. The board which played at is a 3v3 board (9 Total boxes), and the boxes are where X or O are places. 
This first one that makes a straight line is the winner. </p>

<h1>Project's Technological Content</h1>
<p>The game's main technology used is JavaScript. JavaScript is the core of the game as it was used 
to make the game functional by allowing the user to choose if they would like to play with another person or a CPU. 
The game's current state is that X player will always start first whether it is vs CPU or vs a player.
However, the game still only starts based on the mode selected, and it will always show the end result of the game. 
That was all acheived with a combination of some function, querySelectors, adding eventListners, some loops and if statements </p>
<br>
<p>In addition, CSS has been implemented to design and make changes to the UI of the game. For example, some of the techiques that have been used is 
whenever the user hovers on any of the buttons available, the cursor will change from an arrow to a pointer, and it will be highlighted as well. </p>
<br>
<p>Moreover, HTML has been use to structure the web  page content. For example, the board have been placed in the center of the page to make it 
the main focus of the page. There is also the positioning of the buttons and state message of the match whenever the game is played. All of that have been 
acheived by the use of div, button, h1(2,3,4...etc), p, img, and section tags </p>

<h1>Improvements for The Future</h1>
<p>The game can be improved a lot from it's current state and here are some examples: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow selection of X and O for the user</li>
  <li>Add a 4v4 Mode</li>
  <li>include difficulties when played against the CPU</li>
</ul>
